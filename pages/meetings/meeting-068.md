<h2>Local Information</h2>

<h3>HOTEL</h3>

Our hotel is the Nassau Inn, 10 Palmer Square West, Princeton.  Currently
this is the only hotel within walking distance of the University (and it is
right across the street!).  We have a very favorable rate of $178/night,
including breakfast buffet.  I have been told that if you wish to reserve
nights outside our window of 5-9 May, you will get the same rate for the
additional nights.

<p>

The group rate is only available until 5 April.

When you get to the calendar, you must click your check-in and check-out
dates.  On the next screen, you will select your room type.  No need to
add the breakfast option for one person.  You will get free breakfast
vouchers at check-in.  Breakfast is not included for a second person.
